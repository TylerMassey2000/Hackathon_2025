        <h1>About Exposed ULA</h1>
        <p>Ever wonder what nasty things are included in terms of service, privacy policies, and EULAs? Maybe it's time to find out.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>About the Site</h2>
        <p>We made this site so you can quickly see how companies use your data,
             intrude on your privacy, and sometimes things so strange they seem unreal. Use the library tab to view some of the largest companies summaries. You'll find the name of the company and a
             score from zero to ten, ten being safe, zero being an evil virus from satan. Click on the title and you'll get a drop down of the five worst offenders in the company's
             legal documents. In the AI section you can add a link to a site and get an instant score and top five.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>Often times legal documents are long enough it makes you wonder if they ever intended someone to read it. Sometimes they are hard to find, and sometimes
            they are updated without clear communication to the users. All of these can put you at risk and let companies get away with things they shouldn't.
            Sometimes it takes a strong voice to get violations of privacy and rights fixed, and sometimes it can be clear sign to stop using a service. For example,
            you probably don't want to be using a social media site that claims ownership of your photos and videos, or may choose not to make an account for a site 
            that sells your data. Our hope is that this service will lead to both educated and quick decisions. 
        </p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Our Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>By using this website you agree to let us own your first owned cat. Just like old times. If you use this service and it fails to work,
             you are expected suck your thumb, do five jumping jacks, and drink a glass of milk. No, we don't care if you're lactose intolerent. 
            If you have any questions they should be directed to your first true love. Failing to do so will result your ownership of your first owned dog, too.
        That's a joke, of course, but you might be surprised by what you find in what you have already agreed to...</p>
